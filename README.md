# Description

## Overview
This project implements an image compression algorithm using **Huffman coding**, aimed at reducing image file sizes without compromising visual quality. The algorithm efficiently encodes image data to optimize storage and improve transmission speed.

## Features

- **Lossless Compression**: Leverages Huffman coding to compress images without any loss in quality, ensuring accurate reproduction of the original image.
- **Multi-Format Support**: Handles common image formats like JPEG, PNG, and BMP, providing flexibility for various compression tasks.
- **Visual Comparison Tool**: Includes a feature that enables users to compare the original image with the compressed version, visually highlighting the compression results.
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Offers customizable settings for compression levels, allowing users to fine-tune the algorithm according to their specific requirements.
